# NYC-Bus-Project
For this project I answered 3 questions regarding bus breakdowns and delays in NYC.
1.  What are the most common reasons for delays and breakdowns?
2.  How do delay times vary by bus company and borough?
3.  Is there a correlation between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdowns or delays?
