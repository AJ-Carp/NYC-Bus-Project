# NYC-Bus-Project
For this project I answered 3 questions regarding bus breakdowns and delays in NYC.

This is real data that comes from [NYC open data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bus-Breakdown-and-Delays/ez4e-fazm/data_preview). I also must give credit to Alex Freburg for creating the [excel course](https://www.analystbuilder.com/courses/excel-for-data-analytics) on analyst builder that helped me make this project.

###1.  What are the most common reasons for delays and breakdowns?

###3.  How do delay times vary by bus company and borough?
    
###4.  Is there a correlation between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdowns or delays?
